            <br/>

            <p>Please carefully read the following bylayws and policies. These terms and policies are non-negotiable, and their enforcement is at the discretion of the DUMUNC Secretariat and Duke University.

            <p>Please note that “conference center” refers to the Durham Convention Center facilities, NOT the Durham Marriott City Center. We are not responsible for any delegates, delegations, advisors, events, or actions outside of the doors of the conference center (i.e. in the hotel).</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Preference Policies</strong></p>
            <p>You will receive an email from the Secretary-General within the next couple of weeks asking for a complete delegation manifest and committee and country preferences. Please do not reach out to Duke University Events for preference questions. All preference questions should be directed to <a href="mailto:dumuncsecgen@gmail.com">dumuncsecgen@gmail.com</a>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>School Policies</strong></p>
            <p>Only delegations representing an established school are permitted to register for DUMUNC. This is a change from last year.

Please reach out to the Secretary-General <strong>as soon as possible</strong> should you have any concerns about this policy.</p>
            <br/>

              <li><strong>No delegate or delegation is permitted to enter the conference center without at least one advisor. This includes all committee sessions, break sessions, and social events, INCLUDING THE DELEGATE DANCE. THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY. Any delegate or delegation found to be in violation of this policy will be asked to immediately leave the conference center until an advisor is present in the building. Repeated violations of this policy will result in dismissal from the conference due to legal and safety concerns regarding minors.</strong></li>
              <li>No advisor or delegate will be allowed to enter the conference center without their nametag, issued to each participant upon registration on the first day of the conference.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>The entire conference will be cancelled in the event that an inclement weather or other major event prompts the closure of Duke University. Closure of Duke University is at the discretion of the school administration—DUMUNC staff and the Duke International Relations Association have no authority on the matter. In the event of a conference cancellation, all advisors will be promptly notified via email as soon as possible. Importantly, cancellation of the conference does not necessarily mean that the Durham Marriott City Center will close. Please check with the hotel administration to verify your lodging accommodations and process refunds where applicable.</li>
              <li>In the event of conference closure before the beginning of Opening Ceremonies on February 16, 2018, all delegations will be fully refunded all delegate and school fees. We will not reimburse for lost costs associated with travel or accommodations.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Other Policies</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>While in the conference center, all advisors and delegates are subject to all regional and federal laws of North Carolina and the United States of America. Furthermore, all advisors and delegates will be subject to all Duke University rules and regulations. Violation of any law or Duke University regulation will be handled by the administration of Duke University, no exceptions.</li>
              <li><strong>WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO DISMISS ANY DELEGATE, ADVISOR, OR DELEGATION FROM THE CONFERENCE AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON.</strong></li>
            </ul>
